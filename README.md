2. Create an environment from the `conda-lock.yml` file by running the command `conda-lock install --name online-shopping-prediction conda-lock.yml` in terminal.
3. Activate the environment by running the command `conda activate online-shopping-prediction`.
4. Open JupyterLab by running the command `jupyter lab` in terminal.
5. Change the kernel in the JupyerLab web application:
    - Under the `Kernel` tab, click on `Change Kernel...`
    - Select the `Python [conda env:online-shopping-prediction]` option in the dropdown that pops up.
